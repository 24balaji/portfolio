      <p>What is Origami? Origami is the art of paper-folding. Its name derives from Japanese words ori (“folding”) and kami (“paper”). Traditional origami consists of folding a single sheet of square paper (often with a colored side) into a sculpture without cutting, gluing, taping, or even marking it.It was first invented in JAPAN, A Thousand years ago,That's why we don't know who invented origami.But we know that in 1950s Master Yoshizawa Akira worked on original mordern origami.He is also known as father of mordern origami.what is the importance of origami? Origami excites other modalities of learning. It has been shown to improve spatial visualization skills using hands-on learning. Such skills allow children to comprehend, characterize, and construct their own vernacular for the world around them.With origami, it's possible to create large structures that fold up for transportation or for squeezing into tiny spaces. And the intricate folding patterns can be used to make complex mechanical systems with movements that can be controlled by a single motor.
